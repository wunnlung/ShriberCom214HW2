Hiiiiii so this is my project
Just really quick, I do know that you can see when I get stuff done for this website, and I do feel bad about getting it done literally LAST MINUTE
I don't normally do my projects last minute, but I've been really busy recently with an algorithms homework that I submitted late, the new algorithms homework from this week, my research seminar, and interviews for an internship! In case you are curious, I did actually get the internship, so I'm very happy about it.
